## Academic Wood Crafting

Wood carving became a hobby for me in 2014. I was working through my undergraduate degree, had a part time job, and typical life stress. I began to wood carve to unplug from pages upon pages of text. However, the pages of academic text and people teaching, supporting and encouraging me became inspiration for wood carving.
